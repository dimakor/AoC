Program: 2,4, 1,5,7,5,1,6,4,2,5,5,0,3,3,0

3, 0: do nothin (or jump A !=0 to beginning)
0, 3: A / 2 ** 3 = A / 8
5, 5: output 0, B % 8 = 0
4, 2: B ^ C = B
1, 6: B ^ 6 = B
7, 5: A / 2 ** B = C
1, 5: B ^ 5 = B
2, 4: A % 8 = B

1. A = 0
2. A = 0
3. output 0, B % 8 = 0
4. B ^ C = B
5. B ^ 6 = B
6. 0 / 2 ** B = C ( c = 0)
7. B ^ 5 = B
8. A % 8 = B
